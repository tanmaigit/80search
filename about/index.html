            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>
                We built 80Search.com as a nostalgic throwback, designed to whisk you away to the neon-soaked, synth-driven glory of the 1980s. We built this space as a vibrant, nostalgic sanctuary—a pleasant reminder of those simpler, pre-digital times before technology moved from our desks into every waking moment of our lives.
            </p>

            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>
                Our mission is to capture that radical spirit and bring a splash of retro color to your daily workflow. Every time you open a new tab, you'll be greeted by a randomly curated collection of iconic imagery, from the geometric patterns of arcade floors to the soft-focus glow of analog memories.
            </p>
